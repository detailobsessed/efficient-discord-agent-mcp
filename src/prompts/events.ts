EVENT CREATION STEPS:

1. CHOOSE EVENT LOCATION:
${
  eventType === "EXTERNAL"
    ? `   - Provide external location (URL or address)
   - Example: "https://zoom.us/j/123456789" or "Central Park, NYC"`
    : `   - Use list_channels to find available ${eventType === "STAGE_INSTANCE" ? "Stage" : "Voice"} channels
   - Create a new channel if needed using create_${eventType === "STAGE_INSTANCE" ? "stage" : "voice"}_channel`
}

2. SET EVENT DETAILS:
   - Name: Clear, descriptive title (max 100 characters)
   - Description: What to expect, who should attend, what to bring
   - Scheduled Start: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)
     Example: "2025-02-15T19:00:00.000Z" for Feb 15, 2025 at 7 PM UTC
${eventType === "EXTERNAL" ? "   - Scheduled End: Required for external events" : "   - Scheduled End: Optional for server events"}

3. CUSTOMIZE EVENT IMAGE (Optional):
   - Use modify_scheduled_event after creation
   - Upload cover image for better visibility
   - Images appear in event list and invitations

4. PROMOTE YOUR EVENT:
   - Create announcement using send_rich_message
   - Include event URL in announcement
   - Pin announcement in relevant channels
   - Share event link outside Discord

5. MANAGE INTERESTED USERS:
   - Use get_event_users to see who's interested
   - Send reminders before event starts
   - Use list to plan capacity

EVENT TIMING BEST PRACTICES:
- Schedule at least 24 hours in advance for better attendance
- Consider time zones for your community
- Avoid conflicts with other server events
- Set reminders 1 hour and 15 minutes before start

TIMEZONE CONVERSION:
Your local time must be converted to UTC (ISO 8601 format).
Use a tool like: https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html

Example: Creating a gaming tournament on Saturday at 3 PM EST:
- Start: "2025-02-15T20:00:00.000Z" (3 PM EST = 8 PM UTC)
- Name: "Weekend Gaming Tournament - Season 5"
- Description: "Join us for competitive matches! Prizes for top 3 players."
