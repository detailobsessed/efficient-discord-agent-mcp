WARNING: PHASE 3 PREVIEW - Auto-Moderation tools will be available in v2.0.0 Phase 3

AUTO-MODERATION SETUP GUIDE:

1. RULE CONFIGURATION:

   Rule Name: Descriptive identifier
   - Example: "No Slurs", "Anti-Spam", "Mention Limit"

   Trigger Type: ${ruleType}
   ${keywordConfig}
   ${mentionConfig}

2. TRIGGER ACTIONS:

   Available Actions (can combine multiple):
   - Block Message: Prevent message from being sent
   - Send Alert: Notify moderators in a channel
   - Timeout Member: Temporary mute (duration configurable)

   Recommended combinations:
   - Keyword filter: Block + Alert
   - Spam: Block + Timeout (60 seconds)
   - Mention spam: Block + Alert + Timeout (5 minutes)

3. EXEMPTIONS:

   Roles exempt from rule:
   - Typically: @Moderator, @Admin
   - Allows staff to use blocked words for moderation
   - Use role IDs to specify exemptions

   Channels exempt from rule:
   - Admin channels
   - Testing channels
   - Bot command channels

4. ALERT CHANNEL:

   - Create dedicated #automod-alerts channel
   - Set permissions: Admin/Mod only
   - Receives notifications when rule triggers
   - Include: Username, message content, rule triggered, timestamp

AUTOMOD BEST PRACTICES:

1. Start Conservative:
   - Begin with preset filters
   - Add custom keywords gradually
   - Monitor false positives

2. Layer Your Defense:
   - Combine multiple rule types
   - Use keyword + spam detection together
   - Add mention limits for all public channels

3. Regular Maintenance:
   - Review triggered rules weekly
   - Update keyword lists based on trends
   - Adjust thresholds if needed
   - Remove outdated rules

4. Communication:
   - Inform members about auto-mod in #rules
   - Explain what content is filtered
   - Provide appeal process for false positives
   - Keep moderation transparent

5. Testing:
   - Create a mod-only test channel
   - Test rules before deploying server-wide
   - Verify exemptions work correctly
   - Check alert messages format properly

EXAMPLE AUTO-MOD SETUP FOR COMMUNITY SERVER:

Rule 1: "Profanity Filter"
- Type: keyword_preset
- Preset: Profanity
- Action: Block message
- Exempt: @Moderator, @Admin

Rule 2: "Spam Prevention"
- Type: spam
- Action: Block + Timeout (60s)
- Alert Channel: #mod-alerts

Rule 3: "Mention Spam Limit"
- Type: mention_spam
- Limit: 5 mentions
- Action: Block + Alert
- Exempt: @EventOrganizer (for announcements)

Rule 4: "Prohibited Topics"
- Type: keyword
- Keywords: ["referral", "cryptocurrency", "investment"]
- Action: Block + Alert
- Alert Channel: #automod-alerts

IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:

Phase 3 (Coming in v2.0.0 final) will include:
- create_automod_rule
- list_automod_rules
- modify_automod_rule
- delete_automod_rule
- get_automod_rule

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:

Until Phase 3 is released, you can:
1. Use Discord's built-in Auto-Mod in Server Settings
2. Configure rules manually through Discord interface
3. Use read_messages + delete_message for manual moderation
4. Use timeout_member for violations
5. Document your desired auto-mod config for Phase 3 migration

Current Phase 2 moderation tools available:
- read_messages: Monitor channel content
- delete_message: Remove violating messages
- bulk_delete_messages: Clean up spam quickly
- timeout_member: Temporarily mute violators
- kick_member: Remove problematic users
- ban_member: Permanently ban repeat offenders

Would you like help setting up manual moderation workflows until auto-mod tools are available?`,
